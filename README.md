# Master Thesis
This is an attempt at writing a transparent master thesis. Find the proposal for my thesis [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/kcvxttvcqdxk). The most recent draft version of the thesis is available [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/ggznrkmtkwxp). Anyone reading this is more than welcome to [contact me](mailto:prieger@ethz.ch?subject=[Transparent%20Master%20Thesis]%20Inquiry) at any time. An interactive version of the simulation study in my thesis is available as a shiny app [here](https://prieger.shinyapps.io/miapp/).

## Current work
Doing some final work on application section (see open questions below) and polishing all draft versions.

## Open Questions
Does it ever make sense to set detection methods to just detect item-wise violations of metric MI? Novel method not able to distinguish between metric and scalar MI. Unclear if the existing methods really are? The reason why I didn't implement this feature for the novel approach was that the two components obviously affect each other just as in standard linear regression the removal/inclusion of a non-zero intercept will change the regression coefficient.
