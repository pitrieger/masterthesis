# Master Thesis
This is an attempt at writing a transparent master thesis. Find the proposal for my thesis [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/kcvxttvcqdxk). The most recent draft version of the thesis is available [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/ggznrkmtkwxp). Anyone reading this is more than welcome to [contact me](mailto:prieger@ethz.ch?subject=[Transparent%20Master%20Thesis]%20Inquiry) at any time.

## Current work
I am currently working on an application of the methods. This serves as a proof of concept for more general CFA models (e.g. with multiple latent variables) and for some fun.
